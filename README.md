Game Service:
click any square next to an empty box in the picture (not diagonally). At this point, the puzzle should get mixed up. 

Stylistic Changes:
in src/App.js in the "user_preference_size" variable, you can resize the board (note the image does not always match the size).
The image can be changed using the url/road link to the img folder in the ./src/components/Puzzle.css file in the ".tile" zone. Next to the place to change the picture there is a comment "user image change"
